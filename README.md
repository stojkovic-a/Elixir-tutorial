# Elixir-tutorial
Distributed key-value store as an elixir tutorial example.


## Getting started

Requires Erlang and, Elixir as specified in the [.tool-versions](./.tool-versions) file.

Elixir installation documentation is available [here](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html).

Erlang installation documentation is available [here](https://www.erlang.org/downloads).

It is suggested to install them using a version manager such as [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) for that.

Elixir plugin for asdf is available at (https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-elixir) while erlang plugin is available at (https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang).

## Building

Building:
```
cd kv_umbrella
mix deps.get
mix compile
```

Starting for development with live reload:

```
iex -S mix
```

Then, to use the app, in a separate terminal:

```
telnet 127.0.0.1 4040
````

## Deployment:

After building the app:

```
MIN_ENV=prod mix release foo
MIX_ENV=prod mix release bar
_build/prod/rel/foo/bin/foo start
_build/prod/rel/bar/bin/bar start
```

Once again to use the app, in a separate terminal:

```
telnet 127.0.0.1 4040
```

## User instructions:

* Application has a server listening on a port 4040 by default this can be changed by setting the system environment variable PORT to the desired value.
* Available commands to interact with the Key-Value store are:
  * **CREATE** _bucket_name_  -  Used to create a new bucket by the name of _bucket_name_ which stores key-value pairs.
  * **PUT** _bucket_name_ _key_ _value_  -  Sets the given value for a given key in a given bucket.
  * **GET** _bucket_name_ _key_  -  Return the value associated with a given key in a given bucket.
  * **DELETE** _bucket_name_ _key_  -  Removes the given key value pair from a given bucket.
* kv_umbrella/config/runtime.exs defines the routing table for development and for production. It describes how are bucekts distributed across available nodes.
* kv_umbrella/mix.exs defines the number and names of nodes in application. Each of the releases equals to one node.

## Project description:

Project is meant as a demonstration and a tutorial of BEAM's (Bogdan / Bj√∂rn's Erlang Abstract Machine) also known as Erlang Virtual Machine, capabilities for achieving fault tolerant and highly available systems.  

Primarily used here is Elixir programming language which also runs on Erlang Virutal Machine but with a more modern syntax. 

Different modules are used here to demonstrate different components that are combined to create a fault tolerant system.

Firstly project is a umbrella type elixir project which means that it consists of 2 separate applications weakly bound together through a one-way dependency. Applications are in kv_umbrella/apps directory:

| Applications  | Description                                                | 
| ------------- |:----------------------------------------------------------:| 
| kv            | Key-value store. Manages buckets. Periodic permanent save. |
| kv_server     | Listends on a socket. Parses commands. Calls kv metgods.   |

---

Elixir achieves fault tolerance throgh concurency. Every elixir application consists of separate Elixir processes. Elixir process are very lightweighted and are all exectued in a single OS process. Each of the Elixir processes run concurently and their execution is controlled by the Elixir process schedular. In a single Elixir process code is exectued sequentially. Each of the Elixir processes can spawn antother procces using a _spawn()_ method. Beside creating each other process can also communicate through message passing. Everything an application needs can subsequently be achived through spawning a process to either exectue some statemnts, to hold a cetrain state, or to supervise and restart another process.

### KV:

* KV.Bucket module is an Agent process. Agents are processes that are designed to hold a cetrain state and return it when needed. Elixir provides _use Agent_ as a way to inject code into a module that will provide us with methods necessary to write to a state and get the value from a state. Here each bucket holds arbitrary number of key-value pairs. Agents are started with a start_link function that must be implemented in a module. State of an agent can be accessed and chaged afterwards with instructions such as:
  * **Agent.get()**
  * **Agent.update()**
  * **Agent.get_and_update()**

You can read more about Agents [here](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/agents.html).

* KV.Registry is a GenServer process. GenServers are processes that are meant to receive requests as messages from other processes and to handle each message with a corresponding method. Similar to agents code is injected into a module with _use GenServer_ that provides methods needed to receive requests and send replies. Notable methods in KV.Registry module are:
  * **start_link()** method is called to initialize KV.Registry module. It calls _GenServer.start_link()_ method which intializes GenServer. We are required to hadnle the GenServer initialization, that is _use GenServer_ requires that we overload a method **init()**.  Here specifically ets (Erlang Term Storage) and an unnamed map are initialized and set as a state of GenServer. Unnamed map is a simple hash table data structure and regarding ets you can read about it [here](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/erlang-term-storage.html).
  * Other methods required by _use GenServer_ are **handle_call()** which is a method that handles synchronous requests and **handle_cast()** which is a method that handles asynchronous requests. GenServer also provides a **handle_info()** as a way to handle direct process messages to GenServer.

You can find out more about GenServers [here](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/genservers.html).
* KV.Saver module is also a GenServer process. This module is worth mentioning because it implements a common Elixir design pattern where GenServer sends message to itself periodically to ensure that an action is executed periodically. Here specifically key-value store content is saved to a file periodically. More info about working with files in elixir can be found [here](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/io-and-the-file-system.html).

* KV.Supervisor is a Supervisor process. Code is injected with _use Supervisor_. Supervisors are processes that observe other processes and restart them if they crash and/or if they finish executing.
  * **start_link()** here starts the Supervisor by calling its _start_link()_ method.
  * Which we have to implement with a **init()** method. To start a Supervisor we need to define its children. When a Supervisor starts it also starts each of its children. Often, as is also the case here, Supervisor starts other Supervisors and creates a whole hierarchy of supervision. This Supervisor starts one DynamicSupervisor used to monitor buckets. DynamicSupervisors are used when number of children changes dynamically. It also starts modules KV.Saver, KV.Registry and, Task.Supervisor by the name of KV.RouterTasks. Task.Supervisors are used to ensure simple Tasks are executed correctly. More on [Tasks](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/task-and-gen-tcp.html#tasks).

More on Supervisors [here](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/supervisor-and-application.html) and [DynamicSupervisors](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/dynamic-supervisor.html).

* KV.Router is module that reads the routing table from _runtime.exs_ and routes requests to the correct node.
* KV module is entrance for the KV application. It injects the code _use Application_ which enables us to implement the starting function of the application:
  * **start()** which starts the top supervisor in the Supervision hierarchy.
* **mix.exs** file in KV application is a file that describes the application and its dependencies. It is also a file where we specify whcih module has the application entrance. Here it is KV module.
```elixir
  def application do
    [
      extra_applications: [:logger, :jason],
      env: [routing_table: []],
      mod: {KV, []}
    ]
  end
```
